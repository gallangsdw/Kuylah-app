# About This Project
Yogyakarta is one of the cities that attracts many traveller and students outside the city, or even tourist from abroad. With their several nicknames, two of them are City of Students and City of Tourist, make this city has many destinations to travel. But, some outsiders are confused to start where they want to go and it takes more time to search one by one. 

5 of our team are students from outside this city, and we find it difficult when we want to travel in Yogyakarta. Some of us are just asking our friends to recommend the places and it can be biased because the preferences might be different.  In order to tackle this problem, we build an app to recommend the user where should they go in Yogyakarta with just a few inputs.
